\section{Data collection methodology}
\label{section:experiments}

To generate the load we have implemented two different clients:
(i) data writer and (ii) data fetcher. The writer was generating
data for $n$ tags and pushing into the cloud over the Internet 
in batches of size $1000$ samples per batch. The writer was 
concurrently pushing data for $n$ tags (one thread per tag).
Here we were logging such parameters as batch start and end 
time, batch number and tag (this allowed us calculating the 
performance later on). Data fetcher was querying the data 
for $m$ tags for 1 hour period. Here we logged start time,
end time, iteration and tag name. Again such information 
allowed us to calculate the performance for various number 
of tags.
