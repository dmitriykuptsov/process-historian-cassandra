\section{Data collection methodology}
\label{section:experiments}

To generate the load, we have implemented two different clients: 
(i) data writer and (ii) data fetcher. The writer was generating 
data for $n$ tags and pushing into the cloud over the Internet 
in batches of size $1000$ samples per batch. The writer was 
concurrently pushing data for $n$ tags (one thread per tag). 
Here we were logging such parameters as batch start and end time, 
batch number, and tag (this allowed us to calculate the performance 
later on). Data fetcher was querying the data for $m$ tags for 
random 1-hour period. Here we logged start time, end time, iteration number, 
and tag name. Again, such information allowed us to calculate the 
performance for various numbers of tags. We did not experiment with 
the mix load when data was simultaneously written and read from the system.
