\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this document we have described our effort related to building a 
process historian database using Python Flask and NoSQL Cassandra
database. We have completed the entire challenge in roughly 24
hours. To measure the performance we have experimented with various
read and write loads, but not the mixture. All-in-all we believe 
that the system can be used in rather small setups as it is,
but should be well tuned for large scale deployments. Also, we should
note that the further analysis is required: (i) we think that the performance
should be measured for longer periods of time, and (ii) impact of compaction and 
data removal should be considered thoroughly. Furthermore, investigation of 
inadequate write performance deserves a separate attention.
