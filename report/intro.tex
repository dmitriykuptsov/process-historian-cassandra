\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

Process Historian is a must in modern IoT applications:
such database is used for storing the time-series readings
from various sensors. Process Historian should hold
the following properties: (i) it should be durable to node failures,
(ii) it should be scalable horizontally, (iii) it should guarantee 
fast writes to the disk, (iv) it should have clean design.

In what follows we present MVP for such database that uses 
Cassandara NoSQL database and Python Flask user facing 
web service. The solution is a result of 24 hours challenge.
The source codes for our implementation can be found 
in~\cite{git}.


In Figure~\ref{fig:arch} we show rather abstract architecture of our deployment.
Thus in the setup we had 4 nodes deployed in the DigitalOcean
cloud: (i) 3 nodes for Cassandra cluster; (ii) MySQL, Nginx,
and single REST API server were deployed on single computing node;
(iii) we had multiple data generators running on local machine.

The Cassandra row design is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:schema}.
It is basically consists of a wide row (1 day long) and a composite
partition key: tag plus date bucket.

The parameters for Cassandra clusters are the following (see
Table~\ref{tab:params})

\begin{table*}[htp!]
  \caption{Cassandra parameters}

  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \hline
    {\bf Parameter}                                  & {\bf Value } \\
    \hline
    Number of nodes in the cluster                   & 3       \\
    Replication factor                               & 2       \\
    Node RAM size                                    & 2 GB    \\
    TTL                                              & 1 year  \\
    Number of seed nodes                             & 1       \\
    Partitioner                                      & uniform (Murmur3Partitioner) \\
    Read and write consistency                       & quorum  \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

The remaining parameters where left unchanged and were configured
during the release of Cassandra 4.1.9 by the developers.
